### 22. Wildcard Matching

Sunil is a little scientist. Sunil has planned to design a wildcard pattern matcher to exhibit at the "**Young Inventors**", a tech talent show organized at his school.

Sunil wanted to design the wildcard pattern matcher supporting the wildcard character '**?**'. The wildcard character '**?**' can be substituted by any single lower case English letter for matching. He has two strings `X` and `Y` of equal length, made up of lower case letters and the character '**?**'.

Sunil wants your help in designing the device, to know whether the strings `X` and `Y` can be matched or not. Write a program to check whether the given strings can be matched or not.

### **NOTE:**
Print '**No**' if the length of strings are not equal.


### **Input Format:**
  - The first line of the input contains the string `X`.
  - The second line of the input contains the string `Y`.

### **Output Format:**
Output a single line with the word "**Yes**" (*without quotes*) if the strings can be matched, otherwise output "**No**" (*without quotes*).
