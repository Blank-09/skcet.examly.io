### $24.$ Right Triangle of Dots 

The much-awaited event in the entertainment industry every year is the "**Screen Awards**". This year the event is going to be organized on December $25$ to honor the Artists for their professional excellence in Cinema. The Organizers of the event, J&R Events, decided to design the logo of the Screen Awards as a digitized image and display it on the LED panel boards for the show promotions all across the venue. The Event team wanted to border the logo with right triangles which will describe it better.

For this purpose, the Event development team is in the task to find if $N$ dots can make a right triangle or not (*all $N$ dots must be used*). Given $N$ dots, we can make it look like a Right Triangle (*45-45-90 triangle*) exactly with $N$ dots. Rearrange the given $N$ dots, like this:

Your task is to help the team write a program using functions to find if $N$ dots can make a right triangle or not.

### **Function Specifications:**
Use the function name, return type, and the argument type as:

  - `int find(int)`

The function must return $1$ if you can make a right triangle using $N$ dots, else return $0$.

### **Note:**
The main function is already provided and well defined. The function mentioned above is to be defined by you to solve this problem

### **Input format**
The first line of the input consists of an integer $N$.

### **Output format**
Output "**Yes**" (*without quotes*) if you can make a right triangle using $N$ dots, otherwise "**No**" (*without quotes*).
