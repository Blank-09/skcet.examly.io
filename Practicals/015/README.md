# Practicals Preparation Questions
## **Looping Statements**

### $15.$ Fibonacci series starts from $0,1$ and the next number should be the sum of the previous two numbers.

  - $0+1=1$, so the next number in the Fibonacci series in the C program is 1.
  - Similarly, `0 1 1 2 3 5 8...` and so on.

Write a program to generate *Fibonacci series* up to `n` terms using **while loop**

### **Input Format:**
The input consists of the value of `n`.

### **Output Format:**
The output prints the **Fibonacci series**.
