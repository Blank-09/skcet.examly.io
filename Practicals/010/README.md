# Practicals Preparation Questions
## **Exception Files**

### 10. You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator.

  - Create a *class **MyCalculator*** which consists of a single method `long power(int, int)`. This method takes two integers, `n` and `p`, as parameters and finds `np`.
  - If either `n` or `p` is *negative*, then the method must `throw` an **Exception** that says **"n and p should be non-negative"**.
  - Also, if both `n` and `p` are *zero*, then the method must throw an *Exception* that says "**n and p should not be zero"**.

Complete the function `power` in **class MyCalculator** and *return* the appropriate result after the `power` operation or an appropriate exception as detailed above.

### **Input Format:**
  - `n` value as an integer in the first line
  - `p` value as an integer in the second line

### **Output Format:**
Calculated power value or appropriate exception
