### 25. BMI Calculator

The simple measure of body fitness is the BMI or Body Mass Index. It depends only on the height L and weight `W` of a person. It is defined as `BMI = [weight / height^2]` where weight is taken in kilograms and length in meters. Four general grades are proposed:

  - `Underweight   [U] - when BMI < 18.5`
  - `Normal weight [N] - 18.5 <= BMI < 25.0`
  - `Heavyweight   [H] - 25.0 <= BMI < 30.0`
  - `Overweight    [O] - above or equal to 30`.

Write a program that takes in the Weight (*in Kg*) and Length (*in meters*) of an individual and displays the grade as `U`, `N`, `H`, `O`.

### **NOTE:**
Bind the data members and the member functions inside the class


### **Input Format:**
Input to get two values `W`, `L` denoting the Weight and the Length.
  - `W` is an integer.
  - `L` is a decimal value.

### **Output Format:**
print the BMI Grade as `U`, `N`, `H`, or `O`.
